## üí° How to Use

### On-Demand Synchronization

- Click the **sync icon** (üîÑ) in Obsidian's left ribbon.
    
- Or, use the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for "Sync with GitHub".
    

### Automated Sync in Action

With `Auto Sync` enabled, SyncMate runs silently in the background, keeping your vault synced. Monitor activity via the status bar.

### Exploring File History

To view file history:

- Right-click a Markdown file in the File Explorer.
    
- Select "Show GitHub File History".
    
- A modal lists commits; view content or restore past versions.
    

### Exploring Folder History

To view folder history:

- Right-click a folder in the File Explorer.
    
- Select "Show GitHub Folder History".
    
- A modal displays commits affecting files in that folder. View changed files per commit, and view/restore individual files from those states.
    

### Resolving File Conflicts

When a file changes locally and remotely, a conflict occurs.

- If **Conflict Resolution Strategy** is "Ask me each time," a modal appears for side-by-side comparison:
    
    - **Keep Local Version:** Prioritize local changes.
        
    - **Keep Remote Version:** Adopt the GitHub version.
        
    - **Try Auto-Merge:** Attempt a simple line-based merge.
        
- Other strategies resolve conflicts automatically.
    

### Advanced Operations: Force Pull & Force Push

Found in plugin settings under "Advanced Operations." Use with extreme caution.

- **Force Pull from GitHub:** **DANGER ZONE:** Downloads and _**overwrites**_ **all local files** with GitHub versions. **Any unsaved local changes are permanently lost.**
    
- **Force Push to GitHub:** **DANGER ZONE:** Uploads and _**overwrites**_ **all files on GitHub** with your local versions. **Any remote changes (including those by others) are permanently lost.**
    

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

Common issues and solutions:

- **`Connection failed` / `Invalid GitHub Token`:**
    
    - **Double-check PAT:** Ensure correct copy, no spaces, and `repo`/`public_repo` scope.
        
    - **Confirm Owner/Repo Name:** Ensure exact match (case-sensitive).
        
- **`404 Not Found` (Repository/Branch/File):**
    
    - **Double-check spelling:** Verify `Repository Owner`, `Repository Name`, `Branch`.
        
    - **Verify Sync Path:** Ensure it's correct or blank for root.
        
- **`409 Conflict` during push:**
    
    - Remote file was modified. Consider "Ask me each time" strategy for manual review.
        
- **Files not synchronizing:**
    
    - **Active internet connection?**
        
    - **Correct `Sync Path`?** Are files within it?
        
    - For diagnostics, check Obsidian developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option + I`).
